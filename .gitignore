# DANGER!!!
# This repo is not for your website!
# You should never commit files from your site here!!!
# If you want to use git to develop your site, change into `public_html` and clone a repo into that folder, or use git init
# If you do use this repo, everything you commit will be undone, VVV always resets site provisioner repos to the remote version

# So Ignore everything
*
# And explicitly extra ignore htdocs and public_html
/htdocs/
/public_html/
# VVV will hard reset and pull on provision,
# and you will lose all your work
# DANGER!!!

# But don't ignore these files that VVV needs
